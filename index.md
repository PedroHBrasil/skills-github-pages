title: Welcome to my blog

My name is Pedro and I'm had some fun doing this.

# This should be a big title

Should I say Hello World? Yes (guess the language).

```
if (sayHelloWorld) {
  println!("Hello World");
}
```

###### This should be the smallest title

And this should be a list:
 - list item 1
 - list item 2
 - list item 3

What about a checklist?

 - [ ] not checked
 - [x] checked
 - [ ] not checked

## Table, anyone?

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| var1 | 1 |
| var2 | 2 |
| var3 | 3 |

### An image, of course!
